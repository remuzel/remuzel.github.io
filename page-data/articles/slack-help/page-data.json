Let me give you an example of an all too common script that isnt quite right.</p>\n<pre><code>BOB: Hey\n\nME: Hi    \n\nBOB: *Bob is typing...*\n\nME: *I am waiting...*\n\nBOB: How are you?\n\nME: Fine thanks.\n\nBOB: *Bob is typing...*\n\nME: *I am waiting...*\n\nBOB: Could help me with X?\n</code></pre>\n<p>So why is this a problem? As soon as that first message is sent, I get a notification on my laptop. I stop the work I am doing and navigate to the chat. When I get there, I see \"hi\" and nothing else. I then have to wait for the user to formulate the question. This is valuable time I could have been using to focus on my work. </p>\n<p>Then, out of politeness I am asked \"How are you?\". I know the intentions are good but odds are I would rather be working, than small talking.</p>\n<h1>All this can be fixed with a comma</h1>\n<pre><code>BOB: Hey, I was wondering if you could help me with X.\n\nME: *Already starting to type about the thing you need!*    \n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Ask For Help On Slack","desc":"Fixing your slack messages with one character."}}},"pageContext":{}}}
